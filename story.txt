Once upon  time, there was a lion sleeping peacefully in the unruly Jungle. 
	His name was Joe and he liked sleeping in the sun. Even though the jungle was a very dangerous place to sleep he still felt comfortable because he knew he could defeat anyone who came for him. He awoke suddenly when he heard a strange noise. It didn't sound like anything he had ever heard in the jungle before and he decided he needed to discover its source.
	The noise was so loud, like one of his lion comrades screeching as loudly as possible. As he raced through the jungle to find the source of the noise, he finally found what he was looking for...a fellow lion stuck impossibly high in a massive tree. 
	He was surprised and questioned. Right after, he jumped and climbed tirelessly to reach the fellow lion. Because his idea was not working, he ran towards a pool of water and found his big, tough friend -- Mr Elephant. Mr. Elephant strucked the tree with his strong head and body, and the tree broke apart. Joe was happy.
