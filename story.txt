Once upon  time, there was a lion sleeping peacefully in the unruly Jungle. 
	His name was Joe and he liked sleeping in the sun. Even though the jungle was a very dangerous place to sleep he still felt comfortable because he knew he could defeat anyone who came for him. He awoke suddenly when he heard a strange noise. It didn't sound like anything he had ever heard in the jungle before and he decided he needed to discover its source.
	The noise was so loud, like one of his lion comrades screeching as loudly as possible. As he raced through the jungle to find the source of the noise, he finally found what he was looking for...a fellow lion stuck impossibly high in a massive tree.
	Joe was surprised and questioned. Because he believed that great power comes with great responsibility, he wanted to help. Joe jumped and climbed tirelessly but did not help. So, he ran towards a pool of water and found Mr.Elephant, a huge and tough friend, drinking water. Joe asked Mr.Elephant to help his friend. Mr.Elephant took a few distances away to gain momentum and he hit the tree with great energy. The tree broke apart and Joe's friend fell on the ground happily.
